# Elixir

The Elixir is a monoblock ergonomic mechanical keyboard. The design has been greatly inspired by the [Atreus](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus), [Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) and [Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) keyboards.

## Motivation

The Elixir was born out of a desire to create an 'introductory' ergonomic mechanical keyboard. It has a simple and inexpensive construction and support for most keycap kits.
