# Elixir

The Elixir is a monoblock ergonomic mechanical keyboard that has support for most keycap kits. The design has been greatly inspired by the [Atreus](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus) [Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) and [Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) keyboards.

# Purpose

The Elixir was born out of a desire to create a gentler introduction to ergonomic mechanical keyboards. It supports regular modifiers on the outer most-columns, reducing friction to those who already have their own keycap sets. Furthermore, it's simple and inexpensive construction will further lower barriers to entry as those who want to 'give it a shot' can do so without much time or monetary investment.
